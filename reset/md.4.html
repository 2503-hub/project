    <h1>Module 04: Password Cracking Techniques and Countermeasures</h1>
    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <p>Password cracking is the process of recovering passwords from the data transmitted
         by a computer system or from the data stored in it. The purpose of cracking a password might
          be to help a user recover a forgotten or lost password, as a preventive measure by system administrators
      to check for easily breakable passwords, or for use by an attacker to gain unauthorized system access.
        The labs in this module will provide you with a real-time experience
         in exploiting underlying vulnerabilities in target systems using various password
          cracking techniques and tools.</p>

    <h2>Objective </h2>
    <p>The objective of this lab is to monitor a target system remotely and
         perform other tasks that include, but are not limited to:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Bypassing access controls to gain access to the system (such as password cracking)</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Overview of Password Cracking</h2>
         <p>Hacking often begins with password-cracking attempts. A password is a key piece of information necessary
             to access a system. Consequently, most attackers use password-cracking techniques
              to gain unauthorized access. An attacker may either crack a password manually by guessing
               it or use automated tools and techniques such as a dictionary or a brute-force method.
                Most password-cracking techniques are successful because of weak or easily guessable passwords.</p>

        <h2>Lab Tasks</h2>   
        <p>In this lab, we will use numerous tools and techniques to hack the target systems. 
            Recommended labs that will assist you in learning various passwork cracking techniques and countermeasures
             include:</p> 
        <ol>
            <li>Perform active online attack to crack the system's password</li>
        </ol>  
        <ul>
            <li>Perform active online attack to crack the system’s password using Responder</li>
        </ul>  
        <ol>
            <li>Audit system passwords</li>
        </ol>  
        <ul>
            <li>         Audit system passwords using L0phtCrack</li>
                <li> Audit system passwords using John the Ripper</li>
        </ul>  
        <h1>Lab 1: Perform Vulnerability Assessment to Identify Security Vulnerabilities
             in the Target System or Network</h1>
             <h3><b>Lab Scenario</b></h3>
             <p>The information gathered in the previous labs might not be sufficient to reveal potential
                 vulnerabilities of the target: there could be more information available that may help in finding
                  loopholes. As an ethical hacker, you should look for as much information as possible using all
                   available tools. This lab will demonstrate other information that you can extract from the target
                   using various vulnerability assessment tools.</p>
        <h3>Lab Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Perform Vulnerability Analysis using OpenVAS</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Task 1: Perform Vulnerability Analysis using OpenVAS</h2>
        <p>OpenVAS is a framework of several services and tools offering a comprehensive and powerful
             vulnerability scanning and vulnerability management solution. Its capabilities include unauthenticated
              testing, authenticated testing, various high level and low-level Internet and industrial protocols,
               performance tuning for large-scale scans, and a powerful internal programming language to implement any
                vulnerability test. The actual security scanner is accompanied with a regularly updated feed of Network
                 Vulnerability Tests (NVTs)—over 50,000 in total.<br><br>
            Here, we will perform a vulnerability analysis using OpenVAS.</p>
        <p>In this task, we will use the <b>Parrot Security (10.10.1.13)</b> machine as a host machine
             and the <b>Windows Server 2016 (10.10.1.16)</b>machine as a target machine.</p>
             <ol>
                <li>Click on <a href="Parrot Security"></a> on your VirtualBox or VMWARE to switch to the <b>Parrot Security</b> 
                     machine.</li>
             </ol>
